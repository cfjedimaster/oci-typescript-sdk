# SDK For TypeScript

The SDK for TypeScript enables you to write code to manage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources.
Although this is a TypeScript SDK, JavaScript developers can still use all the functionality of this SDK. But JavaScript developer may lose out on the intelli-sense provided by TypeScript. JavaScript developers can refer to the services' requests interface to know what parameter names to pass in.

## Requirements

To use the TypeScript SDK, you must have the following:

- An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account.
- A user created in that account, in a group with a policy that grants the desired permissions. This can be a user for yourself, or another person/system that needs to call the API. For an example of how to set up a new user, group, compartment, and policy, see [Adding Users](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/addingusers.htm). For a list of typical policies you may want to use, see [Common Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm).
- A key pair used for signing API requests, with the public key uploaded to Oracle. Only the user calling the API should be in possession of the private key. For more information, see [Configuring Credentials](https://google.com).
