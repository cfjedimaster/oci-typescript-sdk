## Running Examples

1.  Git Clone the TypeScript SDK
2.  Run npm install
3.  Create your configuration file in your home directory (~/.oci/config). See [Configuring the SDK](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
4.  cd into a feature directory's example folder. i.e ./oci-typescript-sdk/lib/identity/examples
5.  Run any of the example file/s. i.e:

    ts-node "./oci-typescript-sdk/lib/identity/examples/identity-examples.ts"

6.  Some examples are available in JavaScript. They are located in the each service's example/javascript folder. For the JavaScript equivalent:
    node "./oci-typescript-sdk/lib/identity/examples/javascript/identity-examples.js"
