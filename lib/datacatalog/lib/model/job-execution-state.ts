 * Common execution states for jobs in data catalog.
 * CREATED     - Job has been created but yet to start execution. It will transition to IN_PROGRESS when resources are available for execution.
 * IN_PROGRESS - Job is currently executing.
 * INACTIVE    - Job has been paused by the worker. This could be due to resource contention or window management.
 * FAILED      - Job has failed due to errors during execution.
 * SUCCEEDED   - Job has successfully completed execution.
 * CANCELED    - Job has been aborted by the worker due to a user request.
